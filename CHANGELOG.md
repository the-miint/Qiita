# Changelog

The "what changed" log for this repo, one bullet per change. The git history is
the authoritative record; the per-line `(#N)` tag traces each entry to its PR.
Operator deploy steps live separately in
[`DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md`](DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md) — keep the two from drifting into
each other (a change can warrant an entry here, a step there, or both).

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The
project does not cut versioned releases yet, so everything lands under
**Unreleased**. Every PR adds an entry here (CI `changelog-check`; opt out with
the `no-changelog` label).

## [Unreleased]

<!-- (#70) is a placeholder PR number for the host-reference-filtering branch;
     confirm/replace when the PR is opened (68, 69 currently open). -->

### Added

- Host references for host-read filtering: `is_host` column on `qiita.reference`,
  the `reference_index` table tracking built indexes, an `indexing` reference
  status (`loading → indexing → active`), and the `host-reference-add` workflow
  that builds a rype `.ryxdi` negative-filter index (`build_rype_index` native
  job + `register-index` library action) (#70)
- `GET /reference` (list; filter by `kind` / `is_host` / `status`) and
  `GET /reference/{reference_idx}/index` (list a reference's built indexes) (#70)
- `qiita reference load --host` — create a host reference (or bind an existing
  one) and run `host-reference-add`; requires `--taxonomy` (#70)
- Arrow Flight DoPut upload domain + chunked reference-load pipeline (#49)
- Support for known-missing and terminology-term metadata values (#56)
- `/health` aggregator probing CP + CO + DP with cached aggregation, a
  three-pill per-service status strip on the landing page, and gRPC reflection
  on the data plane (closes #54) (#58)
- bcl-convert workflow: container image, workflow YAML, and build script;
  `QIITA_IMAGES_DIR` with container bind/path resolution; the `bcl_convert_prep`
  native job; per-sample sequenced-sample minting via `qiita submit-bcl-convert`;
  the `SEQUENCED_POOL` scope target (#62)
- Self-hosted OpenAPI docs at `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc` (ReDoc), linked
  from the landing page and served from vendored assets (no CDN) (#64)
- `changelog-check` CI gate requiring every PR to record its change here (opt
  out with the `no-changelog` label) (#65)

### Changed

- The SLURM backend now propagates `SHARED_FILESYSTEM_ROOT` into the compute-node
  job environment, so native steps that derive a persistent path from it (e.g.
  `build_rype_index` writing the rype `.ryxdi`) resolve the real shared root
  instead of the `/tmp/qiita` default (#70)
- Centralized all REST path string literals into `qiita-common`'s
  `api_paths.py` (closes #12) (#60)
- Bumped the study / prep_sample identity sequence start to 25000 (#61)
- Moved the `reference load` command from `qiita-admin` to the `qiita` end-user
  CLI (it is a credentialed API call, not a host operation) (#63)
- Renamed the operator deploy checklist `CHANGELOG.md` → `DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md`;
  `CHANGELOG.md` is now this per-change log (#65)
- Scoped the `push` CI trigger to `main` so PR branches get a single
  `pull_request` run instead of duplicate push + PR runs (#65)

### Fixed

- Assert `HumanUser` before reading `.system_role` in the sequenced-sample /
  biosample routes (closes #45) (#59)
- Closed deploy gaps surfaced by the first user-CLI fastq-to-parquet smoke
  test (#57)
